# CHAT BOT FOR MESSENGER ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this application

## Installation

**_ first you need to make a developer Meta App and add messenger settings to it  _**
[click here](https://developers.facebook.com/apps)


**- then you generate an access token for your page and add 4 Subscription Fields -**


`messages` `messaging_postbacks` `messaging_optins` `messaging_optins` `message_deliveries`

**__ last you need add a webhook link for ur server deployment __**


this link should be the end point that recive the hub requests from FB and send the callbacks  

# Dependencies


as shown in requirements.txt

**_ you need to update tokens variables to your tokens from facebook-developer site _**

## Desription
this is a chat bot build with `Django` and linked with a developer `Meta` app with a webhook 

we used a `sqlite3` for DataBase
